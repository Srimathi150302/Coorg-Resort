            <h2>COORG</h2>
            <p>Situated at a southern fringe of the state of Karnataka, sharing a border with the hilly districts of Kerala, Coorg (now re-named Kodagu) is renowned for its mist draped mountains and its lush coffee and spice plantations. The region normally receives an annual rainfall of 3000 mm spread over 6 months from the southwest monsoons during June extending to September, supplemented by cyclonic rains from the east between November and December. The river Kaveri originates in the hills of Coorg, on the eastern face of the Western Ghats and with its tributaries draining through most of Coorg, provides sustenance to the people along its banks. The river is also of great cultural significance to many people in South India.</p>
